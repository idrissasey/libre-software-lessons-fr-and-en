\section{Starter}

\begin{frame}
  We have seen....
\end{frame}

\section{TP1}

\begin{frame}{Study the four "freedoms" of proprietary softwares}
  By groups of 3, in 45 minutes :
  \begin{itemize}
  \item open a framapad/etherpad
  \item taking examples, analyse how proprietary software limits one or more of the 4 freedoms.
  \item the sharing of works will be made on a common pad
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{alertblock}{General guideline}
	Always give relevant references 
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\section{TP2}

\begin{frame}{Free Software and corporations ?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Is there a particular governance with free software in the corporations you know or you work at ?
  \item Do you use free licensed librairies for your company projects ? 
  \end{itemize}

We will share all replies onto the given pad.  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Classification of free software licenses
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Classification}

\begin{frame}{Diffusive license}

  \begin{block}{Main purpose}
    Prevent to extract value from free software without giving back own contributions.
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Definition (Pellegrini, Canevet)}
    \textbf{Copyleft} free software license where every contribution using a code under this licensed is subjected to the same terms.
   \end{alertblock}

Also know as \textit{\textbf{strong copyleft}}.

Less relevant terms : "viral licenses", "contaminants" (terms to avoid  ideology inside...).
  
Examples : GNU GPL, CeCILL(A)....

Strategically \textbf{expansionnary}.
\end{frame}

%\subsection{Persistantes}

\begin{frame}{Persistant license}

\begin{block}{Main purpose}
    Prevent any privatization of the work without applying to derivative works.
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Definition (Pellegrini, Canevet)}
    \textbf{Copyleft} free software license not preventing the use of works placed under their terms with others works under other under licenses (including proprietary ones)
   \end{alertblock}

Also known as \textit{\textbf{weak copyleft}}, sustainable licenses. Mostly for libs.
 
Exemple : GNU LGPL

Strategically \textbf{defensives}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Permissive license}

  \begin{block}{Main purpose}
    Absolute freedom !
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Definition (Pellegrini, Canevet)}
    Free software license without copylefeft which autorize distribution of software without its source code
   \end{alertblock}

Also knwon as \textit{\textbf{copyfree}}

A less rigorous term : permissive licences 

Examples : BSD (BSD 4 clauses, BSD 3, BSD 2), MIT, Apache, CeCILL-B... 

Strategically \textbf{proselytes}.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Scope
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Scope}

\begin{frame}{What is the scope of free software licenses ?}

  \begin{alertblock}{Problematic}
    How do the obligations of the license spread for a given contribution?
  \end{alertblock}

  \begin{block}{General idea}
    Follow the intent/spirit of the initial license    
  \end{block}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item copyleft : keep the code free (more or less)
  \item copyfree : No obligation to distribute the source
  \end{itemize}

Even a diffusive does not have an unlimited spread!
  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Limits of diffusive licences}

Spread is not at all absolute ! (Linux is GPLv2 only...)

  \begin{block}{General purpose of diffusive licenses}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Counterparty
    \item Coexistence
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ascending diffusivity if derivate work based upon original code. Libs and system call (libc is LGPL, Linux is GPLv2 only) ? 
  \item Descending diffusivity : drivers = derivative work ? (use of wrappers)
  \end{itemize}

When is it a derivate work ? Need to study substitutability (link is generic or specific ?)

  \begin{alertblock}{Scope}
    Scope of those licenses is defined by substituability...
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Limits of persistant licenses}

Three cases :

  \begin{itemize}
  \item work using... : If work could be considered as only using the covered work, no obligations (except statically linked, read license)
  \item combined work (reverse-ingenierie and not combined version)
  \item internal modification of the covered work
  \end{itemize}

Preserve the functional scope of the covered work to avoid subversion... (cf MPL, quite easy to subvert)

The scope is defined functionnaly

 \begin{alertblock}{Scope}
 	The scope of the license is the interface.
  \end{alertblock}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Use of permissive license}

  \begin{block}{Main purpose of permissive licenses}
    No obligation to distribute source code with object code.
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Scope}
 	The scope of the license is the file.
  \end{alertblock}

 Again, read the license (SMOG index, see further)
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Compatibility
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{compatibility}

\begin{frame}{What are the compatibilities between licenses ?}

  \begin{block}{Definition : incompatible licenses}
    licenses which impose contradictoy obligations.. 
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{license B is compatible with license A if :}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item rights of B are included in rights of A
    \item obligations of A are included in those of B
    \end{itemize}
  \end{alertblock}

\pause

\begin{alertblock}{\textit{nemo plus juris}}
  \textit{No one can transfer more rights to others than he has..}
\end{alertblock}

Diffusive licenses are by nature incompatible between them ...

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Compatibility explained in one table}

Your code = some code + A + B. Can you distribute it ?

\scalebox{0.7}{
  \begin{tabularx}{14cm}{|X|X|X|X|}
    \hline
\backslashbox{Code A}{Code B}   & Diffusive & Persistant & Permissive \\
\hline
Diffusive & \textbf{Impossible} except compatibility exception & \textbf{Impossible} except compatibility exception & \textbf{Possible} distribution under same terms of A\\
\hline
Persistant& \textbf{Impossible} except compatibility exception & \textbf{Possible}. Distribution OK without covering it with A and B licenses if each module is distributed under his own licence  & \textbf{Possible}. Distribution OK without A license to cover your code and B and if A is distributed under his license. \\
\hline
Permissive & \textbf{Possible}. Distribution under terms of B & \textbf{Possible}. Distribution OK without covering it and A with B license if B is distributed under his license & \textbf{Possible}. No diffusivity. \\
\hline  
  \end{tabularx}
}
\end{frame}


\section{TP3 et TP4}

\begin{frame}{Read and analyse licences. At last !}

\textit{The SMOG grade is a measure of readability that estimates the years of education needed to understand a piece of writing. SMOG is an acronym for Simple Measure of Gobbledygook.}

According to Alexios Zavras, average SMOG grade is 17. Some over 25...

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{GPLv3}

  By groups of 2/3 students and into the given document (GPLv3) read and comment (1h max) :
  \begin{itemize}
    \item no paraphrasing. Your little brother/sister would have to understand
    \item explain what are : software patents, DRM, Anti-Circumvention Law...
    \item explain why this license take this in charge
    \item try to compare with others free software licenses (MIT, Apache, LGPL, AGPL...)
   \end{itemize}
   
  Each group will have to teach randomly chosen parts of the GPLv3 to the whole group.

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/gplv3.png}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{3 questions}
 By groups of 2/3 students :
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Draw by lot 3 questions.
 \item TEach group will have to teach his answers to the whole groupe in 10 minutes max.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

% Good practice and auditing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Good practice and auditing}

\begin{frame}{Some good practice}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item DO NOT remove existing copyrights mentions !
  \item Manage diffusivity
  \item Respect formalism of each license
  \item Think license at the very beginning of the project and all along it !
  \item You will need to only lawyers... But also skillful profiles (not very common)
  \end{itemize}

If not :

\begin{itemize}
\item emergency rewrite of the covered code (worst case scenario)
\item delays in project delivery
\item license violation (court, image of the company, clients loss of trust...hell)
\end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Auditing, what for ?}

Selon \textit{Black Duck Software} :
\begin{itemize}
\item 30\% of companies code source are free software
\item 98\% of companies don't know that...

\end{itemize}

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\linewidth}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/The_Scream.jpg}\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.55\linewidth}
Marketing of \textit{fear} but :

Double constraint :
\begin{itemize}
\item legally : compatibilities (proprietary licences with free ones, free between them...)
\item technically : security breaches of any external component (HeartBleed in OpenSSL, ...)
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\begin{alertblock}{Security breaches}
Luckily, it was free software....
 \end{alertblock}
 
\end{frame}

\subsection{Tools}

\begin{frame}{Auditing, how ?}

\texttt{grep} and essentially three solutions...

\section{Future ?}

\begin{frame}{reciprocity license}

Preliminary : we need qualified legal experts.

  \begin{block}{Problems}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 70\% of Linux contributions come from just a few big coroporations (name them). 
    \item Wikipedia dÃ©pends on Google.
    \item etc
    \item is it still "owned" by the community ? 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{What could we do ?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item "Peer Production license" \textit{(copyfarleft})
    \item "Commons reciprocity license"
    \item "Fair source"
    \item license = wrong path ? Proper laws instead ?
    \end{itemize}
