\end{frame}

\section{Vocabulary}


\begin{frame}{Vocabulary}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{proprietary software} but all software have authors.
  \item \textbf{Copyleft} : \textit{we give rights}, all modified and extended versions of the program must be free as well, under the same terms. You cannot add restrictions to deny other people freedoms.
  \item \textbf{Copyright} :  legal term describing rights given to creators for their works. Under the Berne Convention, everything written is automatically copyrighted from whenever it is put in fixed form
  \item \textbf{Copyleft} is not opposed to Copyright but a clever hack to offer a legal protection for free sharing.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Copyright}

\begin{frame}{Copyright}

With the creation authors obtain intellectual property rights.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Economic rights :
    \begin{itemize}
    \item permit or prohibit the fixation and reproduction of their work
    \item translation, arrangement, adaptation and alteration of the work
    \item distribution of the original or copies
    \item Related rights
    \end{itemize}
  \item Moral right
    \begin{itemize}
    \item right to protect their personal connection with the work
    
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

 \begin{alertblock}{Copyleft is not opposed to copyright}
    Free and proprietary software \textit{copyright}.
  \end{alertblock}

  \begin{alertblock}{EU directive}
    Only the expression of a computer program is protected and that ideas and principles which underlie any element of a program, including those which underlie its interfaces, are not protected by copyright.
  \end{alertblock}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Proprietary software
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Proprietary}

\begin{frame}{Proprietary software}
  General principle : limitations against use, distribution and modification. Used by end-users under predefined conditions.

  \begin{alertblock}{Definition : proprietary software}
    Software who limits at least one of the 4 freedoms of free software.    
  \end{alertblock}

\pause

  \begin{block}{Michel Rocard, 2002, patent battle : 648 no, 14 yes, 18 abs}
   \textit{Creation, freedom, innovation were on the side of free software. The pursuit of profit, and above all the rent, the desire to restrict competition, and to restrain the external innovations, were on the side of big industry.}

\section{Free Software}


\begin{frame}{Free Software}

  \begin{alertblock}{General principle}
    \textit{Free as in free speech, not as in free beer}. Source code is free.
  \end{alertblock}
  Their main difference : modalities of redistribution
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item redistribution but code must stay free : user's should receive a copy of the code under the same terms
  \item redistribution but code must stay free : user's are not guaranteed to receive a copy
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{alertblock}{Definition : free software}
   A program is free software if the \textbf{program's users} have the four essential freedoms.
  \end{alertblock}
  
\end{frame}

% Not the canonical order :
% see https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2014/SFLC-Guide_to_GPL_Compliance_2d_ed.html#copyright-and-copyleft

\begin{frame}{freedom 0 : freedom to run the program}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Absolute freedom to run by anyone without \textbf{any} restriction
  \item A work produced with a free software doesn't have to be free
  \item Some production made by a free software could been seen as a derivative work (compiler mostly).
  \item What about SaaS ?
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{alertblock}{Principe}
     it is the user's purpose that matters, not the developer's one.
  \end{alertblock}
  
  Quick question : Is JSON license free ? \url{http://www.json.org/license.html}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{freedom 1 : freedom to study}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item study without any obstacles (technicals, rights...)
  \item includes the freedom to use your changed version in place of the originalfreedom d'étude
  \item Not obliged to give source code with binaries (by pragmatsim)
  \item Source code should be made available for free or at a low cost
  \item Source code available for at leats 3 years (GPLv3)
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{alertblock}{Principe}
    Again, it is the user's purpose that matters, not the developer's one
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{freedom 2 : freedom to modify}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item absolute freedom. Only restrictions when distribution.
  \item Preserve copyritht ownership (Berne convention)
  \item Identify  contributions
  \end{itemize}
\begin{alertblock}{Principe}
    Always, it is the user's purpose that matters
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{freedom 3 : freedom to redistribute}

Anyone, anywhere (export control, trade sanctions...)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Conditions of redistribution : main difference between all free software licenses :
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strong Copyleft}
    \item \textbf{Weak Copyleft}
    \item \textbf{Copyfree}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Always identify contributors (Berne convention)
  \item Preserve original authors' reputation
  \end{itemize}
\begin{alertblock}{Principle}
    User's purpose again and mostly necessary condition for the three others freedoms.
  \end{alertblock}

\begin{alertblock}{When does license apply ?}
\textbf{Redistribution triggers !}

\section{TP1}

\begin{frame}{Study the four "freedoms" of proprietary softwares}
  By groups of 3, in 45 minutes :
  \begin{itemize}
  \item open a framapad/etherpad
  \item taking examples, analyse how proprietary software limits one or more of the 4 freedoms.
  \item the sharing of works will be made on a common pad
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{alertblock}{General guideline}
	Always give relevant references 
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\section{TP2}

\begin{frame}{Free Software and corporations ?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Is there a particular governance with free software in the corporations you know or you work at ?
  \item Do you use free licensed librairies for your company projects ? 
  \end{itemize}

We will share all replies onto the given pad.  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Classification of free software licenses
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Classification}

\begin{frame}{Diffusive license}

  \begin{block}{Main purpose}
    Prevent to extract value from free software without giving back own contributions.
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Definition (Pellegrini, Canevet)}
    \textbf{Copyleft} free software license where every contribution using a code under this licensed is subjected to the same terms.
   \end{alertblock}

Also know as \textit{\textbf{strong copyleft}}.

Less relevant terms : "viral licenses", "contaminants" (terms to avoid  ideology inside...).
  
Examples : GNU GPL, CeCILL(A)....

Strategically \textbf{expansionnary}.
\end{frame}

%\subsection{Persistantes}

\begin{frame}{Persistant license}

\begin{block}{Main purpose}
    Prevent any privatization of the work without applying to derivative works.
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Definition (Pellegrini, Canevet)}
    \textbf{Copyleft} free software license not preventing the use of works placed under their terms with others works under other under licenses (including proprietary ones)
   \end{alertblock}

Also known as \textit{\textbf{weak copyleft}}, sustainable licenses. Mostly for libs.
 
Exemple : GNU LGPL

Strategically \textbf{defensives}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Permissive license}

  \begin{block}{Main purpose}
    Absolute freedom !
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Definition (Pellegrini, Canevet)}
    Free software license without copylefeft which autorize distribution of software without its source code
   \end{alertblock}

Also knwon as \textit{\textbf{copyfree}}

A less rigorous term : permissive licences 

Examples : BSD (BSD 4 clauses, BSD 3, BSD 2), MIT, Apache, CeCILL-B... 

Strategically \textbf{proselytes}.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Scope
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Scope}

\begin{frame}{What is the scope of free software licenses ?}

  \begin{alertblock}{Problematic}
    How do the obligations of the license spread for a given contribution?
  \end{alertblock}

  \begin{block}{General idea}
    Follow the intent/spirit of the initial license    
  \end{block}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item copyleft : keep the code free (more or less)
  \item copyfree : No obligation to distribute the source
  \end{itemize}

Even a diffusive does not have an unlimited spread!
  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Limits of diffusive licences}

Spread is not at all absolute ! (Linux is GPLv2 only...)

  \begin{block}{General purpose of diffusive licenses}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Counterparty
    \item Coexistence
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ascending diffusivity if derivate work based upon original code. Libs and system call (libc is LGPL, Linux is GPLv2 only) ? 
  \item Descending diffusivity : drivers = derivative work ? (use of wrappers)
  \end{itemize}

When is it a derivate work ? Need to study substitutability (link is generic or specific ?)

  \begin{alertblock}{Scope}
    Scope of those licenses is defined by substituability...
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Limits of persistant licenses}

Three cases :

  \begin{itemize}
  \item work using... : If work could be considered as only using the covered work, no obligations (except statically linked, read license)
  \item combined work (reverse-ingenierie and not combined version)
  \item internal modification of the covered work
  \end{itemize}

Preserve the functional scope of the covered work to avoid subversion... (cf MPL, quite easy to subvert)

The scope is defined functionnaly

 \begin{alertblock}{Scope}
 	The scope of the license is the interface.
  \end{alertblock}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Use of permissive license}

  \begin{block}{Main purpose of permissive licenses}
    No obligation to distribute source code with object code.
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Scope}
 	The scope of the license is the file.
  \end{alertblock}

 Again, read the license (SMOG index, see further)
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Compatibility
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{compatibility}

\begin{frame}{What are the compatibilities between licenses ?}

  \begin{block}{Definition : incompatible licenses}
    licenses which impose contradictoy obligations.. 
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{license B is compatible with license A if :}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item rights of B are included in rights of A
    \item obligations of A are included in those of B
    \end{itemize}
  \end{alertblock}

\pause

\begin{alertblock}{\textit{nemo plus juris}}
  \textit{No one can transfer more rights to others than he has..}
\end{alertblock}

Diffusive licenses are by nature incompatible between them ...

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Compatibility explained in one table}

Your code = some code + A + B. Can you distribute it ?

\scalebox{0.7}{
  \begin{tabularx}{14cm}{|X|X|X|X|}
    \hline
\backslashbox{Code A}{Code B}   & Diffusive & Persistant & Permissive \\
\hline
Diffusive & \textbf{Impossible} except compatibility exception & \textbf{Impossible} except compatibility exception & \textbf{Possible} distribution under same terms of A\\
\hline
Persistant& \textbf{Impossible} except compatibility exception & \textbf{Possible}. Distribution OK without covering it with A and B licenses if each module is distributed under his own licence  & \textbf{Possible}. Distribution OK without A license to cover your code and B and if A is distributed under his license. \\
\hline
Permissive & \textbf{Possible}. Distribution under terms of B & \textbf{Possible}. Distribution OK without covering it and A with B license if B is distributed under his license & \textbf{Possible}. No diffusivity. \\
\hline  
  \end{tabularx}
}
\end{frame}


\section{TP3 et TP4}

\begin{frame}{Read and analyse licences. At last !}

\textit{The SMOG grade is a measure of readability that estimates the years of education needed to understand a piece of writing. SMOG is an acronym for Simple Measure of Gobbledygook.}

According to Alexios Zavras, average SMOG grade is 17. Some over 25...

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{GPLv3}

  By groups of 2/3 students and into the given document (GPLv3) read and comment (1h max) :
  \begin{itemize}
    \item no paraphrasing. Your little brother/sister would have to understand
    \item explain what are : software patents, DRM, Anti-Circumvention Law...
    \item explain why this license take this in charge
    \item try to compare with others free software licenses (MIT, Apache, LGPL, AGPL...)
   \end{itemize}
   
  Each group will have to teach randomly chosen parts of the GPLv3 to the whole group.

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/gplv3.png}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{3 questions}
 By groups of 2/3 students :
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Draw by lot 3 questions.
 \item TEach group will have to teach his answers to the whole groupe in 10 minutes max.
  \end{itemize}

% Good practice and auditing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Good practice and auditing}

\begin{frame}{Some good practice}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item DO NOT remove existing copyrights mentions !
  \item Manage diffusivity
  \item Respect formalism of each license
  \item Think license at the very beginning of the project and all along it !
  \item You will need to only lawyers... But also skillful profiles (not very common)
  \end{itemize}

If not :

\begin{itemize}
\item emergency rewrite of the covered code (worst case scenario)
\item delays in project delivery
\item license violation (court, image of the company, clients loss of trust...hell)
\end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Auditing, what for ?}

Selon \textit{Black Duck Software} :
\begin{itemize}
\item 30\% of companies code source are free software
\item 98\% of companies don't know that...

\end{itemize}

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\linewidth}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/The_Scream.jpg}\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.55\linewidth}
Marketing of \textit{fear} but :

Double constraint :
\begin{itemize}
\item legally : compatibilities (proprietary licences with free ones, free between them...)
\item technically : security breaches of any external component (HeartBleed in OpenSSL, ...)
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\begin{alertblock}{Security breaches}
Luckily, it was free software....
